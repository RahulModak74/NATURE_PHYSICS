We prove that Synge's world function—a fundamental construct in General Relativity measuring geodesic distance—arises universally on ANY physics-constrained Riemannian manifold, independent of dimension, metric source, or physical domain. We demonstrate that Bayesian Variational Autoencoders naturally construct this geometric structure, enabling computable world functions and Van Vleck determinants for arbitrary systems. Validation across electrochemistry, cybersecurity reveals identical mathematical patterns (√t growth, exponential acceleration, stress accumulation), providing empirical evidence for geometric universality. This unification makes 110 years of differential geometric methods—previously requiring months of tensor calculus—accessible through standard machine learning, with 20-200× computational speedup enabling real-time physics-constrained state estimation.
